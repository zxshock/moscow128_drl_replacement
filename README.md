# moscow128_drl_replacement
Small daughterboard to replace the DRL logic for the programmable Joystick interface, as the pins on my 2DS627 were cut. Also I don't have easy access to the outdated KT3102b transistors. Trust issues with DRL stuff since building my first Pentagon 128 15 years ago also don't help.
