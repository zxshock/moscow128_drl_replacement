# moscow128_drl_replacement
Small daughterboard to replace the DRL logic for the programmable Joystick interface, as the pins on my 2DS627 were cut. Also I don't have easy access to the outdated KT3102b transistors. Trust issues with DRL stuff since building my first Pentagon 128 15 years ago also don't help.  
This shouldn't add more height than 1-2 sockets, depending on how it's soldered. Holes are big enough to fit it onto the underside of a turned socket, might require slightly thinner PCBs than usual - not a problem with most manufacturer's tho from experience.

Built a perfboard prototype so far that's being tested within the next few days.
